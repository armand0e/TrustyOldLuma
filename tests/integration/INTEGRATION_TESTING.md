# Luna Integration Testing

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the integration testing implemented for the Luna Gaming Tool. The integration tests verify that the Luna components work together correctly and that end-to-end workflows function as expected.

## Implemented Tests

### Component Integration Tests

The `test_luna_component_integration.py` file contains tests for:

1. **Luna Core Initialization and Configuration**
   - Verifies that the Luna core initializes correctly
   - Tests configuration loading and updating
   - Ensures configuration changes are persisted

2. **Injector and Unlocker Interaction**
   - Tests starting and stopping the injector and unlocker components
   - Verifies that components can run simultaneously
   - Tests the monitoring task that manages both components

3. **Configuration Migration**
   - Tests migration from legacy GreenLuma and Koalageddon installations
   - Verifies that configurations are properly migrated
   - Tests handling of legacy files and shortcuts

4. **Platform Integration**
   - Tests integration with different gaming platforms (Steam, Epic, Origin, Uplay)
   - Verifies platform-specific configuration
   - Tests platform detection and configuration

5. **Error Handling and Recovery**
   - Tests error handling for invalid configurations
   - Verifies recovery from component failures
   - Tests graceful shutdown even with errors

### Workflow Integration Tests

The `test_luna_workflow_integration.py` file contains tests for:

1. **Complete Luna Installation**
   - Tests the full installation process from scratch
   - Verifies all components are installed correctly
   - Tests configuration and setup

2. **Migration Workflow**
   - Tests the migration process from existing installations
   - Verifies legacy configurations are migrated correctly
   - Tests updating of shortcuts and file structures

3. **Desktop Integration**
   - Tests creation of Luna shortcuts
   - Verifies desktop integration
   - Tests shortcut functionality

4. **Platform Functionality**
   - Tests Luna functionality across different gaming platforms
   - Verifies platform-specific configurations
   - Tests platform detection and integration

5. **Error Handling and Recovery**
   - Tests error handling during workflows
   - Verifies recovery from failures
   - Tests graceful shutdown

### End-to-End Workflow Test

The `end_to_end_luna_test.py` file provides a comprehensive end-to-end test that:

1. Creates a test environment with mock assets and configurations
2. Tests Luna core initialization
3. Tests migration from legacy installations
4. Tests configuration management
5. Tests component interaction
6. Tests platform integration
7. Provides detailed test results and error reporting

## Running the Tests

### Component and Workflow Integration Tests

```bash
python tests/run_luna_integration_tests.py
```

### End-to-End Workflow Test

```bash
python tests/end_to_end_luna_test.py [--verbose] [--no-cleanup]
```

### All Tests

```bash
python run_tests.py --integration
```

## Test Environment

The tests create a temporary test environment with:

- Mock Luna installation directory
- Mock legacy GreenLuma and Koalageddon installations
- Mock asset files (zip archives with mock executables and DLLs)
- Mock configuration files
- Mock desktop shortcuts

This allows the tests to run without requiring actual system resources or making changes to the system.

## Mocking

The tests use mocking to simulate:

- File operations (extraction, download)
- Process management
- Security exclusions
- Shortcut creation

## Conclusion

The integration tests provide comprehensive coverage of the Luna Gaming Tool's functionality, ensuring that:

1. Components work together correctly
2. End-to-end workflows function as expected
3. Migration from legacy installations works correctly
4. Platform integration is functioning
5. Error handling and recovery mechanisms work properly

These tests help ensure that the Luna Gaming Tool provides a reliable and consistent experience for users.
