Normally you should not change this value since it is already filled with necessary default parameters. For Epic Games & Uplay this option is enabled because Koalageddon needs to inject itself into games launched by corresponding platforms to intercept DLC requests. For Origin & Steam this option is disabled because all DLC requests can be intercepted at the platform process itself. Steam integration can actually work using either of the methods, so you could enable DLL injection in Steam games if you enable this option, but I don't suggest this."
