## Luna Integration with Steam Family

### Automatic Configuration

Luna automatically detects and configures Steam Family Sharing:

1. **Family Detection**

   - Luna scans for existing Steam Family configurations
   - Identifies shared libraries and family members
   - Configures injection settings for optimal compatibility

2. **Enhanced Sharing**
   - Luna provides DLC unlocking for shared games
   - Automatic injection for family member sessions
   - Improved compatibility with family sharing restrictions

### Manual Luna Configuration

If automatic configuration doesn't work:

1. **Configure Luna for Family Sharing**

   ```json
   {
     "luna": {
       "platforms": {
         "steam": {
           "family_sharing": {
             "enabled": true,
             "auto_detect_family": true,
             "unlock_shared_dlc": true,
             "inject_shared_games": true
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Add Family Member Games**
   - Use Luna's game management interface
   - Add App IDs for games you want to access from family members
   - Configure per-game injection settings

## Troubleshooting Family Sharing Issues

### Common Problems and Solutions

1. **Can't Join Family**

   - **Issue**: Steam restricts family sharing to actual family members
   - **Solution**: Log into both accounts on the same computer to establish "household" connection
   - **Luna Enhancement**: Luna can help bypass some restrictions through advanced injection

2. **Games Not Showing in Shared Library**

   - **Issue**: Games not appearing in family member's library
   - **Solution**:
     - Verify library sharing is enabled
     - Check game sharing permissions
     - Restart Steam clients
   - **Luna Solution**: Use Luna's game detection to manually add shared games

3. **DLC Not Available in Shared Games**

   - **Issue**: DLC doesn't transfer with shared games
   - **Solution**: Luna's DLC unlocking automatically handles this
   - **Configuration**: Ensure Luna's unlocker is enabled for shared games

4. **Injection Conflicts with Family Sharing**
   - **Issue**: Game injection interferes with family sharing
   - **Solution**: Luna's smart injection system avoids conflicts
   - **Configuration**: Use Luna's family sharing mode

### Advanced Troubleshooting

1. **Multiple Account Login Method**

   **For Account Owner:**

   - Log into your Steam account on the shared computer
   - Enable "Remember my login"
   - Authorize the computer for family sharing

   **For Family Member:**

   - Log into their Steam account on the same computer
   - Accept family sharing authorization
   - Switch back to owner account when needed

2. **QR Code Login (Mobile App)**

   - Use Steam mobile app for quick account switching
   - Generate QR codes for easy login
   - Maintain authorization across sessions

3. **Luna-Specific Solutions**

   ```batch
   # Test family sharing configuration
   python luna.py --test-family-sharing

   # Repair family sharing settings
   python luna.py --repair-family-sharing

   # Configure family sharing manually
   python luna.py --setup-family-sharing
