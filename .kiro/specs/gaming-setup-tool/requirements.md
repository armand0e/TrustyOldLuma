# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a modern, robust Python application to replace an existing batch script that sets up gaming tools (GreenLuma and Koalageddon). The new application will provide a superior user experience with rich text interfaces, progress indicators, better error handling, and cross-platform compatibility while maintaining all the functionality of the original script.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want a visually appealing setup interface with rich text formatting and progress indicators, so that I can easily track the installation progress and understand what's happening.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display a welcome screen with rich text formatting and panels
2. WHEN any operation is in progress THEN the system SHALL show a progress bar or spinner with descriptive text
3. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL display success/failure status with appropriate colors and icons
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with suggested solutions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle administrator privileges automatically, so that I don't have to manually run it as administrator.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL check for administrator privileges
2. IF administrator privileges are missing THEN the system SHALL prompt to restart with elevated privileges
3. WHEN restarting with elevated privileges THEN the system SHALL maintain the current working directory
4. IF privilege elevation fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to create necessary folders and configure Windows Security exclusions, so that the gaming tools work properly without antivirus interference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN folder creation is requested THEN the system SHALL create the GreenLuma folder in Documents
2. WHEN folders already exist THEN the system SHALL skip creation and notify the user
3. WHEN configuring security exclusions THEN the system SHALL add Windows Defender exclusions for both GreenLuma and Koalageddon paths
4. IF exclusion configuration fails THEN the system SHALL warn the user and provide manual instructions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to extract and configure GreenLuma files automatically, so that I don't have to manually handle file operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extracting files THEN the system SHALL extract assets/greenluma.zip to the GreenLuma folder with flattened directory structure
2. WHEN configuring GreenLuma THEN the system SHALL update DLLInjector.ini with the correct DLL path
3. IF the zip file is missing THEN the system SHALL display an error and exit gracefully
4. IF extraction fails THEN the system SHALL display detailed error information
5. WHEN done setting up greenluma THEN the system SHALL review the contents of the GreenLuma folder to ensure antivirus didn't remove any files

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to download and install Koalageddon automatically, so that I don't have to manually find and download the installer.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN downloading Koalageddon THEN the system SHALL download the installer from the official GitHub release
2. WHEN downloading THEN the system SHALL show download progress with a progress bar
3. WHEN installation starts THEN the system SHALL launch the installer and wait for completion
4. IF download fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times before failing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to configure Koalageddon settings automatically, so that it works with the correct configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Koalageddon installation completes THEN the system SHALL replace the default config with the repository version
2. WHEN config replacement fails THEN the system SHALL retry with appropriate delays
3. IF the config directory doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL warn the user and continue
4. WHEN cleanup is needed THEN the system SHALL remove temporary installer files

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to create desktop shortcuts and initial configuration files, so that I can easily launch the tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating shortcuts THEN the system SHALL create desktop shortcuts for both GreenLuma and Koalageddon
2. WHEN creating GreenLuma shortcut THEN the system SHALL use a custom icon if available
3. WHEN setting up AppList THEN the system SHALL create the AppList folder and initial configuration file
4. IF shortcut creation fails THEN the system SHALL warn the user but continue with other operations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues if they occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with suggested solutions
3. WHEN the application exits THEN the system SHALL display a summary of completed and failed operations
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL support verbose logging mode

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to be cross-platform compatible where possible, so that it can potentially work on different operating systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on Windows THEN the system SHALL use Windows-specific APIs for admin privileges and security exclusions
2. WHEN running on other platforms THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle platform-specific operations
3. WHEN detecting the platform THEN the system SHALL adapt behavior accordingly
4. IF platform-specific features are unavailable THEN the system SHALL inform the user and continue with available features

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear next steps and completion information, so that I know what to do after the setup completes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setup completes successfully THEN the system SHALL display clear next steps
2. WHEN displaying completion THEN the system SHALL show links to relevant resources
3. WHEN setup finishes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of what was accomplished
4. WHEN user interaction is needed THEN the system SHALL wait for user acknowledgment before exiting
