# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for rebranding and unifying the GreenLuma and Koalageddon gaming tools into a single, cohesive software package called "Luna".

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Luna detects existing GreenLuma configurations THEN it SHALL automatically migrate them to Luna format
2. WHEN Luna finds existing Koalageddon settings THEN it SHALL preserve and convert them appropriately
3. WHEN Luna encounters old directory structures THEN it SHALL offer to migrate or coexist with them
4. WHEN Luna processes old shortcuts THEN it SHALL update them to point to Luna executables
5. WHEN Luna runs for the first time THEN it SHALL provide clear feedback about any migration actions taken

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user creating shortcuts and accessing Luna, I want all desktop shortcuts and executable names to reflect the Luna brand, so that my desktop and start menu are organized under the new branding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating desktop shortcuts THEN they SHALL be named "Luna" with appropriate descriptive suffixes
2. WHEN viewing the start menu THEN Luna SHALL appear as a single, unified application entry
3. WHEN examining executable files THEN they SHALL have Luna-appropriate names
4. WHEN looking at shortcut icons THEN they SHALL use Luna branding and iconography
5. WHEN accessing context menus THEN all entries SHALL reference Luna consistently

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator managing Luna deployments, I want all configuration files and registry entries to use Luna naming conventions, so that system management is consistent with the new brand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining configuration files THEN all file names SHALL use Luna naming conventions
2. WHEN reviewing registry entries THEN all keys SHALL be organized under Luna branding
3. WHEN checking Windows Defender exclusions THEN they SHALL reference Luna paths and executables
4. WHEN viewing system logs THEN all entries SHALL identify Luna as the source application
5. WHEN managing security settings THEN all references SHALL use Luna terminology

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer extending Luna functionality, I want comprehensive documentation and code comments to reflect Luna branding, so that future development work is consistent with the unified brand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading code comments THEN all references SHALL use Luna terminology
2. WHEN examining docstrings THEN all descriptions SHALL reference Luna functionality
3. WHEN viewing README files THEN all content SHALL be updated to Luna branding
4. WHEN checking inline documentation THEN all examples SHALL use Luna naming conventions
5. WHEN reviewing error messages THEN all text SHALL reference Luna instead of individual tool names

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user of Luna's preconfiguration system, I want the existing setup and configuration management to work seamlessly with the new Luna branding, so that automated setup processes continue to function properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the existing setup system THEN it SHALL automatically configure Luna components
2. WHEN running automated configurations THEN all paths and references SHALL be updated to Luna conventions
3. WHEN processing configuration templates THEN they SHALL generate Luna-branded output
4. WHEN handling batch scripts THEN they SHALL execute Luna operations correctly
