# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the current limited batch script setup approach into a sophisticated Python-based setup application with rich user interface elements including colors, rich text formatting, and organized panels. The new Python setup will provide a more professional, user-friendly experience while maintaining all existing functionality of the batch script setup process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want a visually appealing setup interface with colors and rich text, so that the setup process feels modern and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the setup application launches THEN the system SHALL display a colorful welcome screen with rich text formatting
2. WHEN displaying status messages THEN the system SHALL use color-coded text (green for success, red for errors, yellow for warnings, blue for information)
3. WHEN showing progress information THEN the system SHALL use formatted text with proper spacing and visual hierarchy
4. WHEN displaying section headers THEN the system SHALL use styled text with borders and emphasis

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the setup process organized into clear panels and sections, so that I can easily understand what's happening at each step.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the setup runs THEN the system SHALL organize content into distinct visual panels
2. WHEN displaying different phases THEN the system SHALL use separate panels for admin setup, file extraction, configuration, and completion
3. WHEN showing multiple pieces of information THEN the system SHALL use structured layouts with clear visual separation
4. WHEN displaying lists or options THEN the system SHALL use formatted panels with proper alignment

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want interactive progress indicators and feedback, so that I know the setup is working and how much is left to complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing long-running operations THEN the system SHALL display animated progress indicators
2. WHEN extracting files THEN the system SHALL show a progress bar with percentage completion
3. WHEN downloading files THEN the system SHALL display download progress with speed and ETA
4. WHEN waiting for user input THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual prompts and instructions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing batch script functionality preserved in the Python version, so that the setup process works exactly the same way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the Python setup THEN the system SHALL perform all operations that the batch script currently does
2. WHEN checking for admin privileges THEN the system SHALL handle elevation requests the same way as the batch script
3. WHEN creating folders and extracting files THEN the system SHALL maintain the same directory structure and file placement
4. WHEN configuring applications THEN the system SHALL update the same configuration files with the same values
5. WHEN creating shortcuts THEN the system SHALL generate the same desktop shortcuts with proper icons and paths

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want better error handling and user guidance, so that I can resolve issues more easily than with the batch script.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display detailed error information in a formatted panel
2. WHEN operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide specific troubleshooting suggestions
3. WHEN user intervention is needed THEN the system SHALL display clear instructions with visual emphasis
4. WHEN the setup completes THEN the system SHALL show a comprehensive summary of what was accomplished

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Python setup to be self-contained and easy to distribute, so that it doesn't require additional dependencies to be installed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN distributing the setup THEN the system SHALL include all required Python libraries
2. WHEN running on different Windows systems THEN the system SHALL work without requiring Python to be pre-installed
3. WHEN packaging the application THEN the system SHALL create a single executable file
4. WHEN launching the setup THEN the system SHALL start immediately without additional installation steps

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want keyboard shortcuts and improved navigation, so that I can interact with the setup more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the setup is running THEN the system SHALL support common keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+C to cancel, Enter to continue)
2. WHEN displaying menus or options THEN the system SHALL allow keyboard navigation
3. WHEN showing information panels THEN the system SHALL support scrolling for long content
4. WHEN the setup is complete THEN the system SHALL allow easy exit with keyboard shortcuts
